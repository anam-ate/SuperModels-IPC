The IPC_Arduino Due script controls 215 Neopixel RGBW pixels. A datalogging shield reads RGBW values from a HEX file and
sends this data to the lights. The "200122_csvoutput_with additional lights bytearray.py" file saves out the hex file from Cinema 
4D. 
The IPC_TouchBoard script plays sound files triggered by the Arduino Due script. It uses the wire library.
